# Usage
This is not a package - it's a full Laravel project that you should use as a starter boilerplate, and then add your own custom functionality.

- Copy .env.example file to .env and edit database credentials there
- Run composer install
- Run php artisan key:generate
- Run php artisan migrate
- Run php artisan db:seed
